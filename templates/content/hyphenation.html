	<p>Responsive or not, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t all be designing and building sites on flexible foundations. In a fluid layout, browser width and typographic measure are linked: the wider the viewport, the more characters per line. Keeping in mind that a range of 45-75 characters per line is generally accepted as safe for comfortable reading, there are a few things that can be done to avoid extra long lines of text in fluid layouts. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063" rel="external">Robert Bringhurst</a> recommends for us to leave at least two characters behind and take at least three forward.</p>

				<p>Since hyphens is an inherited property, it isn’t sufficient to set it for a limited number of elements and assume you’re done. You have to make sure you’ve turned it off for the elements that shouldn’t be hyphenated.</p>
